## Test Plan

The following game features / functionality and player actions will need to be tested:

- Testing the function called Grid.
- Testing if the buttons work and placing them.

The following tests will be run against the completed game. The tests should result in the expected outcomes shown.


### Testing the function called Grid

The function did not work. No matter what I try there is always an error message or the code doesn't work. I have desided to remove this function and try something else.

#### Make the thing run

The Grid function didn't run at all.

#### Thought it would at lest run

I thought that the program would at lest run and let me see what the function would do, but it didn't even run.


### Testing the buttons and placing them

I was testing if the buttons would work and if I could place them in the correct places to make the window look more like a game.

#### Testing if the buttons worked as intended

I was testing if the button's would work as I intended them to work as, and to make sure that they did the thing they where programed to do.
Like changing the words on the window to something else.
